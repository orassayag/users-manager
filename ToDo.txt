What would I do If I had more time?
===================================
-Server:
-Write the project in TypeScript, since it was much faster for me to write in pure JavaScript.
-Use Redis or log files persistence to keep the users data. I simulated schema and where needed to keep the data.
-Integration tests by Chai / Mocha / Supertest.
-If needed the CRUD for the users to be updated from the server after for each request - Can be done also.
-Fix ESLint bugs.

-Client:
-Missing filter by country.
-Missing validation of errors on the client in case of error from the server on the CRUD operations.
-Fix a few minor bugs.
-Seperate more the useUsersHandlers.hook.
-More documents inside each function.
-Client Tests for each component.
-Use CDN to load the images, it's not efficient right now.
-Of course, deploy the project on Vercel / AWS.
-Fix ESLint bugs.
